    "body": "Pre-PR discussion from the sharding gitter:\r\n\r\n> My current simulation parameters:\r\n100,000 new blocks, 640 different active validators, 100 attestation changes per block, determining the head each block. Latency factor of 0.8, max-skip slot of 4, epoch length 64.\r\nMy implementation: 11.4 seconds\r\nVitalik's: 34.2 seconds\r\nBut latency affects the branching factor here, and number of validators is also important. Vitalik's may perform better in other situations\r\nE.g. same settings, but with only 64 validators, Vitalik's is ~10.8 seconds, mine is still ~11.5 seconds\r\nEach of the two implementations has their own forte. Mine doesn't care much about total number of attestations, but much more about the number of changes\r\n\r\n> Changing the number of attestation changes here: mine is 47s with same settings, but 64 validators, and 1000 attestation changes per block. (yes, that's 100,000,000 attestation changes in total, minus those that end up attesting the same thing twice). While Vitalik's is 42s. Not as much of a difference, but mine has a slightly harder time handling changes.\r\nKnowing the topology + expected throughput of attestations + expected pruning is everything for a good decision here.\r\nAlthough, there's also one big difference in usage: as a side-effect, the data-structure used in my computation can be used to not just look-up the relative head for the justified block in O(1), and the best child in O(1), but for every other block as well, which could make pruning rather efficient.\r\n\r\n> I.e. you could prune a list of N blocks in O(N). All you have to do is just check their best-target and/or slot number.\r\n",

    "body": "> How many active validators are participating? (i.e. actively attesting)\r\n\r\nIn the worst case up to 4m.\r\n\r\n> How many attestations does a beacon-chain node process per second?\r\n\r\nIn the worst case ~10k.\r\n\r\n> Is there any maximum number of attestations per epoch? (Other than the number of active validators)\r\n\r\nWe can expect every validator to attest every epoch.\r\n\r\n> What is the expected latency? And what is the worst case? Latency is defined here by the number of blocks back up the tree from the local beacon-chain node head, where simulated proposers build on top of.\r\n\r\nRealistically 1-5. But we need to be able to handle larger reorgs due to attackers as well, so probably have a distribution, and include some blocks going much further back. Also include attesters that just go offline some of the time.\r\n\r\n> How many slots per block do we expect? (I.e. avg. skip count)\r\n\r\n1-1.5?\r\n\r\n> What's your view on pruning?\r\n\r\nI think pruning past ~1-3 months is a great idea.\r\n\r\n> Related to 6: When do we delete/store old parts of the chain? (I.e. how big would the list of block-entries be in memory?)\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n> Did I miss any properties?\r\n\r\nIn general, I'd say keep worst-case performance in mind; we don't want something that works amazingly well for the average case but breaks quickly for the worst case. Also don't want something that gets efficiency from complex heuristics that are attackable.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are some efficiency considerations here that the above did not touch upon. It's not that difficult to make LMD GHOST work in _optimistic_ cases for any number of validators, because you just run a pre-processing step that groups together the impacts from all validators whose latest attestations are any specific block B. So if everyone is participating every epoch, you can compute the fork choice rule in time O(64 * log(t)). The challenge is if there is a long tail of most recent blocks, in the worst case one validator per each slot going back the last month or more. It's important to test the fork choice rule in both cases.",
