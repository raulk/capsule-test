    "body": "> We do not even need to include leaves, because much of the time some or all of the information from leaves will be known.\r\n\r\nI'm not quite convinced on this. For example, if we think of EEs as pure state transition functions (for illustrative purposes, I'm breaking up the \"data blob\" parameter into `witness` and `transactions`):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn state_transition(\r\n    beacon_state_root: Bytes32,\r\n    pre_state_root: Bytes32, \r\n    witness: Vec<Bytes32>, \r\n    transactions: Vec<Transaction>\r\n) -> Bytes32;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd we imagine that the state root of the EE is the root of this tree:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// FixedVector[u256; 4]\r\n//\r\n//             +- 1 -+\r\n//            /      \\\r\n//           2       3\r\n//          / \\     / \\\r\n//         4  5    6  7\r\n```\r\nWe'll assume there is silly transaction that simply increases the sender's balance. The EE may receive a transaction package that looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"amount\": 0,\r\n    \"sender\": 2,\r\n    // \"witness\": [\"ABC\", \"DEF\", \"GHI\"]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"amount\": 0,\r\n    \"sender\": 3,\r\n    // \"witness\": [\"JKL\", \"MNO\", \"PQR\"]\r\n  },\r\n```\r\nWhere the witnesses would have been combined into the multiproof: `[\"ABC\", \"JKL\", \"MNO\", \"DEF\"]` (e.g. chunks `[5, 6, 7, 4]`).\r\n\r\nAt this point, when the first transaction is executed and needs the path to the account at address `1`, I'm not sure how it is going to locate the correct chunks from the witness as it has no visibility into what leaves other transactions will be accessing.\r\n\r\nI can think of two possible solutions off the top of my head:\r\n\r\n1. There is an access list which declares the paths that will touched by the transaction package; in which case the EE will be able to calculate the accessed leaf indexes. Maybe this specifies a type of partial that is a subset of the structure described above?\r\n\r\n2. The leaf node indexes are explicitly included in the partial structure.",

    "body": "As discussed during EthBerlin (with Quilt, Vitalik, GBallet) and shared in the call, I created this repository to describe an idea to use helper-data to speed up tree lookups and verification, you could call the first approach \"ssz tree offsets\": https://github.com/protolambda/eth-merkle-trees **_\\[experimental and untested\\]_**\r\nThere is a wide effort to make multi-proof merkle trees better, also in Eth1 (@AlexeyAkhunov, @karalabe, @gballet).\r\n\r\nStoring the bottom node data in a packed form is simplified when you can forget about what exactly is a witness, and what a leaf node. For batching it also makes a lot of sense to me to forget about the difference, as items in the batch may have one witness that is a leaf in another. Merging and verifying is just a lot more complicated (to do efficiently at least) if application differences like this influence lower level encoding.\r\n\r\nAlso, lookups for reading and in-place edits are important if we like to back a partial with a multi-proof, and have the partial behave as an interface. (less memory changes and copies in ewasm if the proof does not need to be deserialized at all).\r\n\r\nThen, an instruction-set like approach (Alexey) is interesting for complicated structures like MPT, but I don't see how well it really speeds up lookups of leaves, and lookups should be cheap (do not construct the whole tree if possible). So I believe an approach with some kind of structural helper data, like the tree-offsets, would be better:\r\n- No memory copies / parsing to make sense of the data\r\n- Scale linearly with the amount of bottom nodes, regardless of structural shape\r\n- Good for lookups: just `O(depth)` operations for lookup. (and possible to shorten during compile time for static parts)\r\n- Good for verification: implemented a multi-proof verify function that scans the data with minimal memory, and constructs the root in a non-recursive manner (no stack-frames, yay). It is experimental and untested though, as I did not have the opportunity to focus on just this.\r\n- Good replacement for those edge-cases where you need to encode dynamic shapes, and do not want to encode full generalized indices.\r\n\r\nFor Merkle Patricia Tree optimizations, representing MPTs as binary trees, and then changing the verification to use a bigger scratchpad-stack to hash hexary nodes, could be a solution to backport these optimizations (or at least run them efficiently in ewasm). And the encoding may also just be a start for a better encoding to back MPTs in Geth, if we add support for MPT extension nodes.\r\n\r\nThe thing where I still have doubts about is where to encode these offsets: it's simple and small, just doable in a single depth-first walk that encodes `2/32` extra data for most proofs. But at the same time there are places where you can know it during compile time and not have to read it from input.\r\n\r\nAfter Eth2 interop week (= ends about 2 weeks from now) I like to pick this up with whoever is working on this. I am leaving it as-is now to focus on phase0 things.",

        "body": "Credits to @vbuterin for exploring partials early on. I rebased his branch on the dev branch, since the older PR (#1184) was based off of an intermediate SSZ implementation, with missing features/bugfixes/types/consistency. Now we are building towards fully SSZ-compatible partials again, incl. use with spec state transition functions.\r\n\r\nStatus:\r\n- initial partials code by @vbuterin refactored (WIP) to be more class-based, to fit seamlessly in with the other SSZ types.\r\n- logistical functions mostly updated to use new types\r\n- need to split some of the helper functions, move their functionality into the partial types. Problem was that every helper func needed a typ param, and did a big switch-like statement on SSZ types. Instead we can generalize this nicely, make type information easily accessible, and move it into the right part of the type inheritance tree.\r\n\r\nSummary of design:\r\n\r\n*note the difference between abstraction levels in the inheritance structure*:\r\n- object: instance of a `SSZValue`\r\n- ssz class: class for an object, instance of `SSZType`\r\n- ssz class type: form of ssz type, subclass of `SSZType`. E.g. some ssz classes are a BasicType, some not. Some are `ElementsType`: they have an `elem_type` and `length` property.\r\n\r\nDue to limitations in python, `Container` has no `ContainerType` metaclass. This means that we use the `__annotations__` attribute to get the fields and their types from a `Container` subclass. These are accessible with `classmethod`-annotated functions, to allow for `typ.get_fields()`: retrieve class information without creating an object (but it does create the class)\r\n\r\nPartials can be modeled as subclasses of the ssz classes. With a `Partials` class mixed in to provide partials functionality (pre-refactor). This enables a partial of a given type to be passed into any function that accepts that regular type.\r\nIn this refactor, I'm splitting the Partials class, so that the different variations can subclass ssz-classes, which lets us get rid of the `typ` argument, and fetch type data like fields, length, element type etc. from the super type. Along with the values in the super class. \r\nGet/Set-item/attribute is overridden to inject the partials logic: retrieve elements/fields from included data, or error when the data is unknown (i.e. not included in the partial)\r\n\r\nI'll post a visual overview of the OOP structure after refactoring some more.\r\n\r\nI think the final idea is to support something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nstate_partial = Partial[BeaconState](data objects, root index)\r\nv = state_partial.validators[my_index]\r\nand...\r\nget_important_value(state_partial)# and any other spec function that accepts BeaconState\r\netc...\r\n```\r\nAnd then we can start building POC light clients on top of SSZ.\r\n\r\n**this is still very experimental, work in progress.**\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Misc ideas\r\n\r\n`SSZValue` (and any subclass) as path root, give the class a `/` operator overload, and then output a `SSZPath`, carrying the generalized index and the type of the path node.\r\nThen also define `/` for the `SSZPath`, and we can use paths to abstract away any light client logic.\r\n*Basic* example:\r\n```python\r\npath = BeaconState / \"validators\" / 123 / \"slashed\"\r\n# see if slashed, in generic way. Could be proving more at the same time.\r\nvalue = some_partial.proof(path.gen_index, False)\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

I'm working to implement the proof format described by @protolambda (see: https://github.com/protolambda/eth-merkle-trees, https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1303#issuecomment-526366715). \r\n\r\nBy ordering the nodes [bit-alphabetically](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1303), it is possible to determine the location of a particular general index's associated hash with the help of a precomputed offset table. This should improve performance significantly as it will avoid the overhead introduced from original `HashMap` approach.\r\n\r\nThree main tasks to be implemented:\r\n- [x] Generate offset table\r\n- [x] Lookup data based on a general index\r\n- [x] Verify the root of a given proof\r\n- [x] Update node values\r\n- [x] Build packager to generate random proofs",

Introductions (10min)\r\n2. Discussion on multiproof formats and proof negotiation (eth2-focused) (50min)\r\n3. Next Steps / Tactics / Open Discussion (optional) (30min)\r\n\r\nProofs are the lifeblood of any light client. We will discuss the landscape of multiproofs. Proof backings / concerns / consumers / request/response interactions / interfaces.\r\n\r\n### Background Reading\r\n\r\n- [Current SSZ Spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/simple-serialize.md) - describes the mechanics of SSZ merkleization\r\n- [SSZ Multiproofs Spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/light_client/merkle_proofs.md) - describes generalized indices and multiproofs\r\n- [New SSZ Spec](https://github.com/protolambda/eth2.0-ssz/) - WIP, includes more motivation and detail around the merkleization/proof side of SSZ\r\n- [Summary of SSZ Multiproof concepts / backings](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/1400#issuecomment-534400064) - see \"RE multi-proof structure:\"\r\n- [SSZ Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT)](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1472) - discussion about adding SMTs to SSZ\r\n- [EE Multiproof Concerns](https://github.com/quilt/pm/issues/2) - great writeup on the expected EE toolchain\r\n- [Experiments w Merkle Trees/Tree-offset Proof Backing](https://github.com/protolambda/eth-merkle-trees)\r\n- [Discussion on Requesting Multiproofs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/644)\r\n- [Discussion on SSZ Partials / Classic Proof Backing](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1303)\r\n- [Turboproof Proof Backing](https://medium.com/@gballet/turboproofs-light-clients-and-saving-private-eth1-487aaa9b386)\r\n\r\n### Discussion Ideas\r\n\r\n- How can we create a unified infrastructure for requesting / handling proofs across phase 0/1 data and EE data?\r\n- How should proofs can be requested/responded by light clients and servers? Where is the overlap between light clients handling Ph0/1 data proofs and block producers handling EE state proofs?\r\n- [your idea here]\r\n\r\n### Previous Meetings\r\n- [Meeting #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY4Qsk22IAE&t=1s)(https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/light-client-task-force-call-1-1aaf559230fb)",
